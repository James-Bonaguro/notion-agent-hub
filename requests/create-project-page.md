template. The page includes the following sections:

- **Overview** — Goal, Scope, and Success Criteria
- **Timeline & Milestones** — Key dates and deliverables
- **Tasks** — To Do / In Progress / Completed kanban-style sections
- **Meetings & Notes** — Space for project-specific meeting sub-pages
- **Resources & Links** — External references, docs, repos
- **Decisions Log** — Record of key decisions with rationale
- **Risks & Blockers** — Risk table with impact and mitigation
- **Retrospective** — What went well, what to improve, action items
